./image_edit_venv/Scripts/activate
```
2. Install dependencies with pip

4. Hold the key ```R``` on the keyboard to start recording audio and release it to stop and process the given command.

### Application Logic Explained
1. The default microphone is used to record voice audio with push-to-talk functionality.
2. The audio is transcribed and translated to english (if necessary)
3. A LLM is used to turn the natural language input into a command for either Lightning-SDXL or ImaginAlry
4. The LLM also decides if the input suggest that a new image should be generated, if the current image should be edited or if it is unable to process the given input
